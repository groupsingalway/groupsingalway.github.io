title: "Twisted conjugacy growth of virtually nilpotent groups"
abstract: "The conjugacy growth function of a finitely generated group is a variation of the standard growth function, counting the number of conjugacy classes intersecting the $n$-ball in the Cayley graph. The asymptotic behaviour is not a commensurability invariant in general, but the conjugacy growth of finite extensions can be understood via the twisted conjugacy growth function, counting automorphism-twisted conjugacy classes. I will discuss what is known about the asymptotic and formal power series behaviour of (twisted) conjugacy growth, in particular some relatively recent results for certain groups of polynomial growth (i.e. virtually nilpotent groups)."
