title: "Dyer groups: Coxter groups, right-angled Artin groups and more"
abstract: "Dyer groups are a family encompassing both Coxeter groups and
right-angled Artin groups. Each of these two classes of groups have
natural piecewise Euclidean CAT(0) spaces associated to them: the
Davis-Moussong complex for Coxeter groups and the Salvetti complex for
right-angled Artin groups. In this talk I will introduce Dyer groups,
give some of their properties."
