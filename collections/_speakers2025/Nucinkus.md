title: "Cohomological finiteness conditions for topological groups"
abstract: "I will give a quick introduction into the classical finiteness conditions $FP_n$ and $F_n$ for a discrete group and then explain how to extend these to certain topological groups. The search for discrete groups that are of type $FP_n$ but not of type $FP_{n+1}$ has a very interesting and rich history. In this talk will present a new family of discrete and topological groups with this property. This is joint work with I. Castellano, B. Marchionna, and Y. Santos-Rego."
