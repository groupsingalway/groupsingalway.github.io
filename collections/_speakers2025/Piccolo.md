title: "Representation zeta functions of subgroups and split extensions of $\\mathrm{SL}_2^m(\\mathcal{O})$"
abstract: 'The representation growth of a group $G$ measures the asymptotic distribution of its irreducible representations. Whenever the growth is polynomial, a suitable vehicle for studying it is a Dirichlet generating series called the representation zeta function of $G$. One of the key invariants in this context is the abscissa of convergence of the representation zeta function. The spectrum of all abscissae arising across a given class of groups is of considerable interest and has been studied in some cases. In the realm of $p$-adic analytic groups (with perfect Lie algebra), the abscissae of convergence are explicitly known only for groups of small dimensions. But there are interesting asymptotic results for "simple" $p$-adic analytic groups of increasing dimension. In this talk, I will give an overview of the main tools and ingredients in this area and I will report on recent work joint with Moritz Petschick to enlarge the class of groups.'
