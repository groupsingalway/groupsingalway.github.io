title: "Strong conciseness and equationally Noetherian groups"
abstract: "The notion of strong conciseness of a group-word extends the classical concept of conciseness from abstract groups to the profinite setting. A word $w$ is said to be strongly concise in a class $\\mathcal{C}$ of profinite groups if, for any $G\\in\\mathcal{G}$, the cardinality of the set of values taken by $w$ in $G$ being strictly smaller than $2^{\\aleph_0}$ implies that the verbal subgroup of $G$ is finite. In this talk we will study the relation between this notion and the notion of equationally Noetherian groups. These groups arise from the theory of algebraic geometry over groups, which we will develop throughout the talk. As a consequence, we will see that every word is strongly concise in the class of profinite linear groups, as well as in the class of profinite completions of virtually abelian-by-polycyclic groups. This is joint work with Andoni Zozaya."
